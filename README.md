# Predictive-Modeling-vs.-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Portfolio-Optimization-Analysis
This project analyzes portfolio optimization strategies using Linear Regression, LSTM models, and Monte Carlo Simulation. Key techniques include mean-variance optimization, Sharpe ratio maximization, CAPM analysis, and risk assessment with VaR and CVaR. Predictive models are compared against actual market data to evaluate performance.
# Key Features
Predictive Modeling: Stock price prediction using Linear Regression and LSTM models.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulates multiple portfolio outcomes for robust strategy comparison.
Portfolio Optimization: Implements mean-variance optimization and Sharpe ratio maximization for asset allocation.
Risk Assessment: Assesses risk using Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR).
CAPM Analysis: Estimates expected returns based on asset risk profiles.
Technical Indicators: Enhances stock prediction and portfolio strategy through indicator analysis.
